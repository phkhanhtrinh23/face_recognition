# Face Recognition For Checking Attendance


## About The Project


### Introduction

My project is called **Face Recognition For Checking Attendance**. This is a model of **classification** which helps a company check whether an employee in the camera (or video) is working at that company.


### Built With

My application is built with these frameworks and tools:
* [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* [GPU Tesla K80](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/data-center/tesla-k80/)
* [Tensorflow 2.6.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.6.0)
* [Python 3.7.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3712/)


## Getting Started

To get started, you should have prior knowledge on **Python** and **Tensorflow** at first. A few resources to get you started if this is your first Python or Tensorflow project:

- [Tensorflow: Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide)
- [Python for Beginners](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)


## Installation and Run

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/phkhanhtrinh23/face_recognition.git
   ```
  
2. Use any code editor to open the folder **face_recognition**.


## Step-by-step

1.  Run `extract.py` to extract frames from videos in the folder `video` and save them in the folder `face_data`.

2. Open the notebook `face_recognition.ipynb` and follow the pipeline in that notebook.

3. The folder `test_data` is a folder of random images from the Internet which is used for testing whether the model works properly or not.

4. Enjoy!
